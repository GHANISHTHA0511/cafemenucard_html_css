        <h2 class="heading" id="about">About Our Cafe</h2>
        <p class="para">The café is located in the centre of Mumbai. Thus it is accessible from all parts of the city. To be more accurate, the café is located near the central bus depot in Mumbai. The place is known as Jehangir Boman Behram Rd and the café is on the front side of the road. This is a perfect place and always remains crowded. But the inner environment of the café is calm, quiet and spacious. It appears that the noise from outside is unable to enter inside the café.<br><br>The café is popular for its special type of coffee. Besides, it also sells various types of light foods in the daytime. But crowds start gathering from the evening. It arranges for fresh barbeques with meat and fish, fried rice, paratha, vegetable curries and other types of local and foreign dishes. The price of the foods is also reasonable as well which is the other cause of getting popularity for this café. I took a barbeque with paratha there and really enjoyed them.</p>
